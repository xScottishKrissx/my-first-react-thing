      Stateless components inherit from stateful components
      Recap
        A stateful component class defines a function that calls this.setState
        The stateful component passes that function down to a stateless component
        That stateless component class defines a function that calls the passed down function
        and that can take an event object as an arguement
        The stateless component class uses this new function as an event handler
        When an even is detected, the parents state updates(A user selects a new item)
        The stateful component class passes down its state, distinct from the ability to
        change its state, to a different stateless component
        That stateless component class receives the state and displays it.
        An instance of the stateful component class is rendered. One stateless child
        component displays the state, and a different stateless child component 
        displays a way to change this.
